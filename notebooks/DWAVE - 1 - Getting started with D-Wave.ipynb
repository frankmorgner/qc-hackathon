It provides a binary quadratic model (BQM) class that contains Ising and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) models used by samplers such as the D-Wave system. It also provides utilities for constructing new samplers and composed samplers and for minor-embedding. Its reference examples include several samplers and composed samplers.\n",
